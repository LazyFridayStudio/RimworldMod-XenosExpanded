This is a very straightforward mod that currently adds in 6 Xeno Races and 4 Faction.

It should be compatible with everything, as it adds in some new Xenos and factions. If there is a bug, report it so I can fix it.

There is a plan to increase the amount of Xenos and factions as well as making Xenos for other mods such as Alpha Genes.
